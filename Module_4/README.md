# Module_4

This module introduces fundamental Python programming concepts through practical examples and tasks. It includes scripts that demonstrate the use of if-else statements, loops, and basic problem-solving.

## Contents

- `Tasks.py`: Contains small tasks such as checking if a number is even or odd, and calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.
- `If_else_Range.py`: Demonstrates the use of if-else and elif statements for decision making, including user input and multiple conditions.
- `Loops.py`: Explains and demonstrates for loops (including nested loops) and introduces while loops, with examples using lists, strings, and ranges.

## Usage
- Use these scripts to learn and practice basic Python control flow: conditional statements and loops.
- Modify the code or add your own examples to reinforce your understanding of these core programming concepts.

This module is ideal for beginners who want to build a strong foundation in Python programming.
