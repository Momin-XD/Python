# Module_2

This module contains Python scripts focused on string operations and object copying techniques.

## Contents

- `String_Operations.py`: Demonstrates various string manipulations, including escape sequences, case conversion, replacement, splitting, joining, and more.
- `Shallow_Deepcopy.py`: Explains and demonstrates the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python, using the `copy` module.

## Usage

### String Operations (`String_Operations.py`)
- Learn about escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\"`, etc.).
- Perform string length calculation, case conversion, replacement, splitting, and joining.
- Practice with real code examples for manipulating and analyzing strings.

### Shallow and Deep Copy (`Shallow_Deepcopy.py`)
- Understand the difference between shallow and deep copying of objects.
- See examples using lists and the `copy` module.
- Learn when to use shallow copy vs. deep copy in your own code.
